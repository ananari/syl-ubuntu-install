This is a shell script for installing a Syloti Nagri keyboard on an Ubuntu machine. This script was tested on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, and provides no guarantees that it will work on other distros or versions of Ubuntu. Once you have run this script as root, you will have to log off and on again in order for the changes to take effect, and then select the keyboard layout in your settings.
