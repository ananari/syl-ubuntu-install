This is a shell script for installing a Syloti Nagri keyboard on an Ubuntu machine. This script was tested on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, and provides no guarantees that it will work on other distros or versions of Ubuntu. To use this script, clone it onto your system, then open the terminal, go to the directory you cloned it to, and type "chmod +x sylinstall.sh" in order to be able to execute the script. After that, type in the name of the file again to execute the script. Once you are done, you will have to log off and on again in order for the changes to take effect.
